Building up your business's community outreach and credability through Google's Review platform

## Insights Pro

Insights Pro is the model that powers this web app. It is a Llama3.1-8B model fine-tuned on data that was collected from 552 business's across North America. Its performence is not amazing, but will improve as the dataset it was fine-tuned on gets better.

The repository which contains all the files I used for the data collection and data processing can be found here: https://github.com/willvo2004/webscrapper-datacurator

This was a very fun project to work on over summer '24 and I hope to finish it off this data science and machine learning adventure with a good website. After all, I'm not even supposed to be doing this AI stuff, I'm a lowly Javascript developer yall.
